"""Core transformation: official requirements list -> uv pyproject.toml + pip constraints.txt.

The published Databricks environment package list (one ``name==version`` per line,
as found in the release-notes "Installed Python libraries" section) is not used
verbatim. A consistent set of rules is applied so the artifacts install cleanly on
a developer machine:

  * Names normalized   - lowercased, ``_``/``.`` -> ``-`` (Cython -> cython).
  * ``==`` -> ``~=``    - allow security/patch bumps within a minor.
  * databricks-connect - pinned to ``~=MAJOR.MINOR.0`` and emitted into
                         ``[dependency-groups].dev`` of the pyproject (installed by
                         default under uv); omitted from constraints.txt so the pip
                         path is constraints-only.
  * Non-installable    - system/OS packages and the Spark client bundle that cannot
    packages dropped     be pip-installed locally or that ship vendored inside
                         setuptools (see DROP / DROP_PREFIX). py4j is kept; pyspark
                         is dropped so DB Connect supplies its own bundled build.
  * requires-python    - taken from the runtime's Python version (major.minor).

This module is imported by ``gen_pyproject.py`` (manual single-env use) and
``sync.py`` (weekly discovery + reconciliation).
